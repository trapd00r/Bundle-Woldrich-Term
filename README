DESCRIPTION
    This module is a bundle of all applications and libraries I've written
    and CPANified that's somewhat related to terminals, or somewhat useful
    in text-based user interfaces.

    It's here mainly because users of some of my applications grew tired of
    installing module after module as they found more and more
    (?:interesting)? stuff in my github repository.
