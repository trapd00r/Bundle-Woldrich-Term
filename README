=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a bundle of all applications and libraries I've written and
CPANified that's somewhat related to terminals, or somewhat useful in text-based
user interfaces.

It's here mainly because users of some of my applications grew tired of
installing module after module as they found more and more (?:interesting)?
stuff in my github repository.
